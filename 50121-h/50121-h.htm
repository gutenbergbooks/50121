  <h2 id='curried' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>CURRIED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five good, fat oysters,
boil the liquor, skim and strain it.
Into a saucepan put one tablespoonful
of butter, slice into it one good-sized
onion; stir and cook until the onion is
a golden brown. Then add a level
tablespoonful of flour, mix and add the
oyster liquor, which should measure
one-half pint. If it does not, add
sufficient chicken stock to make the
quantity; stir until boiling; mix a
teaspoonful of curry powder with a
little stock, a teaspoonful of turmeric,
moistened with a little starch, and boil
again; add one-half teaspoonful of salt
and strain into the upper part of a
double boiler. Have ready now a
griddle, quite hot. Brush it lightly
with butter, throw on four or five of
the oysters; as soon as they sear or
brown, turn them, brown, and throw
them into the curry sauce. So continue
until you have the whole number
cooked. Serve at once.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='sauted' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>SAUTED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five fat oysters, spread
them out on a board, carefully lifting
them with the fingers by the muscular
part. Never stick a fork into an
oyster. With a soft piece of cheese
cloth, dry each one carefully without
bruising. Dust lightly with salt and
red pepper. Have ready a large sheet-iron
sauted pan. Put in the bottom
just sufficient butter to keep the oyster
from sticking. Have at your side
the serving dish, nicely heated, in
which you may put a tablespoonful of
butter, and if you use wine, a tablespoonful
of sherry, and about four
drops of Worcestershire sauce. Now
throw the oysters, a few at a time, into
the hot pan. Shake them. Lift them
quickly as soon as the gills have
curled; put them into the serving dish
and then cook a second lot. Do not
cook over eight at a time. Serve at
once.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='boiled' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>BOILED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter
and then strain or pour it off carefully,
leaving the sediment in the
melting pan. Put the strained butter
in a heated dish in which you are
going to serve the oysters. Have
ready a good-sized kettle of boiling
water. Have the oysters drained
in a bowl, which hold close to
the kettle in your left hand. Now
with a skimmer take out five or six
oysters. Throw them into the boiling
water for just a minute. Then with
the same skimmer take them out, drain
carefully, throw them into the heated
dish of melted butter, and so continue
until you have the desired quantity
boiled. Add then to each twenty-five
a half-teaspoonful of salt and just a
grain of cayenne. Serve smoking hot.
This is one of the most delicious ways
of cooking oysters. If you use wine,
two tablespoonfuls of sherry may be
added.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='newburg' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>OYSTERS A LA NEWBURG</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain fifty oysters; pour over them
a pitcher of cold water. Have ready
a granite pan, smoking hot; throw in
the oysters; add two ounces of butter,
a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter of
a teaspoonful of pepper. Stir carefully
with a wooden spoon until the oysters
are smoking hot. Have ready the
yolks of two eggs beaten with six tablespoonfuls
of cream; add quickly−−do
not boil; then add a tablespoonful
of sherry and serve on nicely browned
toast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='keebobbed' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>KEEBOBBED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain fifty oysters. Boil the liquor,
skim and strain, and stand aside until
wanted. Take the white part from
one root of celery, and slice it very
fine. Chop sufficient parsley to make
two tablespoonfuls. Put out on the
board about a pint of stale bread
crumbs; beat four eggs; add to them
about four tablespoonfuls of oyster
liquor. Now dip each oyster first in
the egg and then into the crumbs.
Arrange them neatly over the bottom
of a baking dish, crowding them just
a little; sprinkle over them salt, pepper,
celery and parsley; then dip
again and put over another layer of
oysters; season, add celery and parsley,
and so continue until the baking
dish is full; having the last layer oysters.
Cut a tablespoonful of butter
into pieces, and put them over the
top; pour a gill of the oyster liquor
over the whole. Bake in quick oven
twenty minutes. Serve smoking hot.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='pan' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>PAN BAKED</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five oysters free from
all liquor. The oysters should be
good-sized and fat. In the bottom of
an individual baking dish put one
square of nicely toasted bread. On
top of this arrange about six oysters;
sprinkle over them a quarter teaspoonful
of salt and a dash of pepper, and
then pour over four tablespoonfuls
of cream. Stand these dishes in a baking
pan, then run into a hot oven for
about ten minutes. Serve at once in
the dishes in which they were cooked.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='tarts' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>OYSTER TARTS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Have ready about half-pound of
French puff paste. Drain fifty oysters.
Put ten into individual baking
dishes. Dust over about a quarter
teaspoonful of salt, a grain of red
pepper, and place in the center a bit of
butter the size of a hickory nut. Roll
the paste into a thin sheet; with a
round cutter stamp out a top. Place
this top over the oysters, brush it
lightly with the yolk of an egg, and
bake in a quick oven twenty minutes.
Serve in the dishes in which they were
baked. These, if carefully made, are
sightly and are certainly very good.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='creamed' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>CREAMED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain fifty oysters; pour over
them a pitcher of cold water. Then
turn them into a saucepan; bring
them to a boiling point, drain again,
this time saving the liquor. Measure
it, and add to it sufficient milk to
make one pint. Put two tablespoonfuls
of butter and two of flour into a
saucepan; mix over the fire without
browning; then add the oyster liquor
and milk; stir constantly until boiling;
add the oysters, and bring just
to boiling point. Take from the fire,
add a teaspoonful of salt, a quarter
of a teaspoonful of pepper, and if you
use wine, two tablespoonfuls of sherry.
Serve at once.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='spindled' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>SPINDLED OYSTERS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five large oysters.
Cut breakfast bacon into very thin
slices, and then cut each slice into
three pieces. Take an ordinary broiling
skewer; run it through the hard
part of an oyster and then back so as
to pin each oyster between two pieces
of bacon; that is, run the skewer
through a piece of bacon as though
you were sticking it with a pin, then
through an oyster, and then through
another piece of bacon, and so on
until the skewer is filled. Arrange all
the skewers neatly on a double broiler;
broil quickly over a clear fire, first on
one side then on the other. Serve at
once on the skewers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='macaroni' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>SCALLOP OF OYSTER AND</span></b> <br /> <b><span class='large'>MACARONI</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Break four ounces of macaroni into
pieces two inches long; throw into
boiling water; boil rapidly thirty
minutes; drain; throw into cold
water for fifteen minutes; drain again.
Drain fifty oysters. Put a layer of
these oysters into the bottom of a
baking dish, then a layer of the boiled
macaroni; another layer of oysters
and macaroni; dusting a little salt
and pepper over each layer; continue
until the dish is filled; having the last
layer macaroni. Cut a tablespoonful
of butter into bits. Put the bits over
the top, and dust thickly with bread
crumbs. Pour over this four tablespoonfuls
of cream, and bake in a
quick oven about twenty minutes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='bisque' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>BISQUE OF OYSTER</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain fifty oysters; boil and skim
the liquor. Chop the oysters with a
silver knife; add them to the liquor;
boil and skim again. Put one quart
of milk in a double boiler; rub together
two tablespoonfuls of butter and three
tablespoonfuls of flour; add this to
the hot milk; stir constantly until
smooth and thick as cream. Add
one teaspoonful of celery pepper and
the oysters. Strain through a sieve,
pressing lightly; add teaspoonful of
salt, and serve at once.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='coquille' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>OYSTERS EN COQUILLE</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Boil in their own liquor twenty-five
fat oysters. Drain, and chop with
a silver knife. Put one cup of milk
in double boiler. Rub together one
tablespoonful of butter and two of
flour; add gradually the hot milk,
beating all the while. Now add yolks
of two eggs, teaspoonful of salt, quarter
teaspoonful of pepper, and a
tablespoonful of green pepper chopped
fine; add the oysters, fill the mixture
into the deep oyster shell, dust with
dry bread crumbs, and brown in a
quick oven. Do not keep them in
long, or the mixture will curdle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='stuffed' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>OYSTERS STUFFED</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five large fat oysters.
Remove the hard part, and fill the
space with a forcemeat made from
quarter cup of finely chopped chicken,
same quantity of crumbs, tablespoonful
of thick cream, a half teaspoonful
of salt, dash of paprica, all mixed well
together. Dust the oysters with salt
and pepper. Beat two eggs without
separating; add to them two tablespoonfuls
of oyster liquor, and one
of warm water. Dip the oysters first
in crumbs, then in the egg mixture,
and then again in crumbs, being careful
not to lose the stuffing. Fry in
smoking hot oil. Serve as fried oysters.
In placing the stuffing, press it
in without bruising the oyster, but
sufficiently firm to keep it in its place.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='mushrooms' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>OYSTERS ON MUSHROOMS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Drain twenty-five fat oysters, and
put two lardoons of bacon through
each oyster. Cut the fat part of ham
or bacon into tiny strips; use a small
larding needle, and just take one stitch
in soft part, then another, allowing the
ends to hang. Dip each oyster in
bread crumbs, then in egg, and then
again in crumbs. Fry in smoking hot
oil. Have ready a platter of baked
mushrooms; put the oysters on top,
cover with brown sauce, and serve.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='baked' class='c008'><b><span class='large'>BAKED MUSHROOMS</span></b></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Peel and cut short the stems from a
pound of good-sized mushrooms; put
